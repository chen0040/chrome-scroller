# chrome-scroller

Chrome plugin to make it easy to read web page by adding automatic scrolling with user controlled speed. This plugin was developed due to my laziness in using the mouse to scroll the web page when i was reading online stories or news. I preferred to have the auto-scroll feature that i can control how fast it scrolls, but i could not find any extension close to my liking and ended up writing this myself.

# Features
* Allow user to automate scrolling of individual web page by clicking "Start" or "Stop"
* Allow user to increase or decrease the scrolling speed of the web page

# Install
 
I have not published this extension in the Google Chrome yet, if you want to use it, follow the instructions below:

* Step 1. git clone this project "chrome-scroller" to your local computer
* Step 2. Open your Chrome browser, type “chrome://extensions” in a tab to bring up the extensions page.
* Step 3. Once on this page, check “Developer mode” to enable loading unpacked extensions. This will allow you to load your extension from a folder. 
* Step 4. Finally, click “Load unpacked extension” or simply drag the entire "chrome-scroller" folder onto the page to load up the extension. You should immediately see the extension show up as a Browser Action with your icon in the toolbar window of the current tab in the Chrome browser.
